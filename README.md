### 🎬 mpv Progress Sync – Cross-Platform Media Progress Sync  
**Lua, Cross-Platform Scripting, Systems Design**  
https://github.com/jstriker87/mpv-progress-sync-cross-platform  

A cross-platform script that synchronises video playback progress across devices for mpv and mpv-android.

**Problem:**
mpv saves progress based on file paths, meaning:
- Moving files breaks progress
- Syncing across devices is impossible

**Solution:**
- Progress is identified using file **size + duration**
- Stored using hashed identifiers for privacy
- Works on:
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - Android
- Designed for use with sync tools like Syncthing

**Highlights:**
- Solves a real usability problem
- Cross-platform engineering
- Portable configuration
- Secure file naming through hashing
- Clean, well-documented setup instructions

Features:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Script portability
- Real-world problem solving

## 🧠 About Me

Before completing my Computer Science degree, I spent over a decade working in telecoms provisioning, technical coordination, and infrastructure projects.  
That background gave me:

- A strong production mindset  
- Reliability and fault isolation thinking  
- Clear communication and documentation habits  
- Comfort working in complex technical environments  

Now I combine that experience with modern backend development skills.

I am seeking a **Junior Backend Engineer** role where I can:
- Build reliable services
- Learn from experienced engineers
- Contribute meaningfully to real production systems
